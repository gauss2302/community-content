## Introduction

ClawdBot is a self-hosted AI assistant that runs continuously on a server.

Once installed, you can interact with it via popular messaging platforms like Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord, and Slack.

This makes it possible to access your AI assistant from any device, anywhere. And you don't need to own a Mac Mini to test it out, just an ordinal cheap VPS will be enough to try it out.


This tutorial covers two installation methods:

- **npm installation** — Recommended for beginners and quick setups
- **Docker installation** — Recommended for production deployments with persistent state

By the end of this tutorial, you will have a running ClawdBot instance that you can access through your preferred messaging platform.
I will try to support you in this beginner frieldnly set up.

**Prerequisites**

- A Hetzner Cloud server with Ubuntu 24.04
- Basic knowledge of Linux command line
- An AI model provider account:
  - Anthropic API key or Claude Code subscription, or
  - OpenAI API key, or
  - Another [supported provider](https://docs.clawd.bot/providers)

**Example terminology**

This tutorial uses the following example values:

- Username: `holu`
- Server IP: `<10.0.0.1>`
- Gateway port: `18789`

Replace these with your actual values where necessary.

## Step 1 - Create a Cloud Server

Log into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) and create a new server with the following configuration:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Location | Your preferred location |
| Image | Ubuntu 24.04 |
| Type | CX22 (2 vCPU, 4 GB RAM) |
| Networking | Public IPv4 enabled |
| SSH Key | Your public SSH key |

Click **CREATE & BUY NOW** and note the server's IP address.

> The CX22 instance provides sufficient resources for ClawdBot. For browser automation skills, consider a server with at least 4 GB RAM.

## Step 2 - Connect to the Server

Connect to your server via SSH:

```bash
ssh root@<10.0.0.1>
```

Update the system packages:

```bash
apt update && apt upgrade -y
```

If prompted to reboot, run `reboot` and reconnect after approximately 30 seconds.

## Step 3 - Create a Dedicated User

It's a bad taste to run everything from the root so we need to create a new user for running ClawdBot:

```bash
adduser agent
```

Set a strong password when prompted. You can skip the other fields by pressing Enter.

Add the user to the sudo group:

```bash
usermod -aG sudo agent
```

Switch to the new user:

```bash
su - agent
```

## Step 4 - Install Node.js

Install nvm (Node Version Manager):

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
```

Load nvm into the current session:

```bash
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"
```

Install Node.js:

```bash
nvm install 24
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

Expected output:

```
v24.13.0
11.6.2
```

## Step 5 - Install Homebrew

It's not a must but some ClawdBot skills require Homebrew. Install it with:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Don't forget to add Homebrew to your PATH:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc
eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## Step 6 - Install ClawdBot

And now, we are ready to install ClawdBot globally:

```bash
npm i -g clawdbot
```

## Step 7 - Configure ClawdBot

Run the onboarding wizard:

```bash
clawdbot onboard
```

The wizard will guide you through the configuration. Use the following recommended settings:

| Prompt | Setting |
|--------|---------|
| Continue? | Yes |
| Onboarding mode | Manual |
| What do you want to set up? | Local gateway (this machine) |
| Workspace directory | `/home/holu/clawd` |
| Model/auth provider | Your preferred provider |
| Gateway port | `18789` |
| Gateway bind | Loopback (127.0.0.1) |
| Gateway auth | Token |
| Configure chat channels now? | Yes |
| Configure skills now? | Yes |
| Node manager | npm |
| Install Gateway service | Yes |
| Gateway service runtime | Node |
| How to hatch? | Hatch in TUI |

Save the gateway token displayed during setup. You will need it to access the dashboard.

## Step 8 - Set Up Telegram (Optional)

To connect ClawdBot to Telegram:

1. Open Telegram and message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the prompts
3. Copy the bot token
4. Enter the token when prompted during ClawdBot onboarding

After the gateway starts, message your bot with `/start` to complete the pairing.

## Step 9 - Access the Dashboard

The dashboard is only accessible via localhost for security. Create an SSH tunnel from your local machine:

```bash
ssh -N -L 18789:127.0.0.1:18789 holu@<10.0.0.1>
```

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://127.0.0.1:18789
```

Enter your gateway token to access the dashboard.

## Step 10 - Docker Installation (Optional)

For production deployments, Docker provides better persistence and easier management.

### Step 10.1 - Install Docker

Connect as root and install Docker:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y git curl ca-certificates
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### Step 10.2 - Set Up the Project

Clone the repository and create directories:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot.git
cd clawdbot

mkdir -p /root/.clawdbot /root/clawd
chown -R 1000:1000 /root/.clawdbot /root/clawd
```

### Step 10.3 - Create Environment File

Generate secure tokens and create the `.env` file:

```bash
GATEWAY_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
KEYRING_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -hex 32)

cat > .env << EOF
CLAWDBOT_IMAGE=clawdbot:latest
CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN=$GATEWAY_TOKEN
CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_BIND=lan
CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PORT=18789
CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_DIR=/root/.clawdbot
CLAWDBOT_WORKSPACE_DIR=/root/clawd
GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=$KEYRING_PASSWORD
XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/node/.clawdbot
EOF

echo "Gateway token: $GATEWAY_TOKEN"
```

Save the gateway token securely.

### Step 10.4 - Create Docker Compose File

Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  clawdbot-gateway:
    image: ${CLAWDBOT_IMAGE}
    build: .
    restart: unless-stopped
    env_file:
      - .env
    environment:
      - HOME=/home/node
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - TERM=xterm-256color
      - CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_BIND=${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_BIND}
      - CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PORT=${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PORT}
      - CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN=${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_TOKEN}
      - GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD=${GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD}
      - XDG_CONFIG_HOME=${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}
      - PATH=/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
    volumes:
      - ${CLAWDBOT_CONFIG_DIR}:/home/node/.clawdbot
      - ${CLAWDBOT_WORKSPACE_DIR}:/home/node/clawd
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PORT}:18789"
    command:
      [
        "node",
        "dist/index.js",
        "gateway-daemon",
        "--bind",
        "${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_BIND}",
        "--port",
        "${CLAWDBOT_GATEWAY_PORT}"
      ]
```

### Step 10.5 - Build and Start

Build and start the container:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d clawdbot-gateway
```

Check the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f clawdbot-gateway
```

You should see:

```
[gateway] listening on ws://0.0.0.0:18789
```

## Step 11 - Manage ClawdBot

Use these commands to manage your ClawdBot installation:

**npm installation:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `clawdbot status` | Check gateway status |
| `clawdbot health` | Run health check |
| `clawdbot logs` | View logs |
| `clawdbot doctor` | Run diagnostics |
| `clawdbot update` | Update ClawdBot |

**Docker installation:**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `docker compose logs -f clawdbot-gateway` | View logs |
| `docker compose restart clawdbot-gateway` | Restart container |
| `docker compose down` | Stop container |
| `docker compose up -d` | Start container |

## Conclusion

You have successfully installed ClawdBot on your Hetzner Cloud server. Your AI assistant is now running 24/7 and accessible through your configured messaging platforms.

The following data persists across restarts:

| Component | Location |
|-----------|----------|
| Configuration | `~/.clawdbot/` |
| Auth tokens | `~/.clawdbot/` |
| WhatsApp session | `~/.clawdbot/` |
| Workspace | `~/clawd/` |
